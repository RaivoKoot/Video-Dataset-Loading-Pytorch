class VideoFrameDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    r"""
    A highly efficient and adaptable dataset class for videos.
    Instead of loading every frame of a video,
    loads x RGB frames of a video (sparse temporal sampling) and evenly
    chooses those frames from start to end of the video, returning
    a list of x PIL images or ``FRAMES x CHANNELS x HEIGHT x WIDTH``
    tensors where FRAMES=x if the ``ImglistToTensor()``
    transform is used.

    More specifically, the frame range [START_FRAME, END_FRAME] is divided into NUM_SEGMENTS
    segments and FRAMES_PER_SEGMENT consecutive frames are taken from each segment.

    Note:
        A demonstration of using this class can be seen
        in ``demo.py``
        https://github.com/RaivoKoot/Video-Dataset-Loading-Pytorch

    Note:
        This dataset broadly corresponds to the frame sampling technique
        introduced in ``Temporal Segment Networks`` at ECCV2016
        https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00859.


    Note:
        This class relies on receiving video data in a structure where
        inside a ``ROOT_DATA`` folder, each video lies in its own folder,
        where each video folder contains the frames of the video as
        individual files with a naming convention such as
        img_001.jpg ... img_059.jpg.
        For enumeration and annotations, this class expects to receive
        the path to a .txt file where each video sample has a row with four
        (or more in the case of multi-label, see README on Github)
        space separated values:
        ``VIDEO_FOLDER_PATH     START_FRAME      END_FRAME      LABEL_INDEX``.
        ``VIDEO_FOLDER_PATH`` is expected to be the path of a video folder
        excluding the ``ROOT_DATA`` prefix. For example, ``ROOT_DATA`` might
        be ``home\data\datasetxyz\videos\``, inside of which a ``VIDEO_FOLDER_PATH``
        might be ``jumping\0052\`` or ``sample1\`` or ``00053\``.

    Args:
        root_path: The root path in which video folders lie.
                   this is ROOT_DATA from the description above.
        annotationfile_path: The .txt annotation file containing
                             one row per video sample as described above.
        num_segments: The number of segments the video should
                      be divided into to sample frames from.
        frames_per_segment: The number of frames that should
                            be loaded per segment. For each segment's
                            frame-range, a random start index or the
                            center is chosen, from which frames_per_segment
                            consecutive frames are loaded.
        imagefile_template: The image filename template that video frame files
                            have inside of their video folders as described above.
        transform: Transform pipeline that receives a list of PIL images/frames.
        test_mode: If True, frames are taken from the center of each
                   segment, instead of a random location in each segment.
